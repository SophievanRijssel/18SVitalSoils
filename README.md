R script for dada2 for 18S metabarcoding data. It includes a part on cutadapt to make sure the inverse part of the backward primer is cut off as well.
It's from 2018, so it might be outdated / not perfectly optimal. 
The script is free to use. Please note down the repository and/or the manuscript (which is under consideration at the timepoint of writing).
